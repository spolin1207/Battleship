## Battleship

Simple battleship game in java. Game board objects are defined for the user and opponent, as well as various ship objects. The opponents ships are hardcoded onto the board (also represented in "enemyboard.txt" if you want to peek), and the user attempts to sink the ships while the opponent makes random guesses. You can run Driver.java, while will allow you to perform attacks as well as see the updated game boards. You can place your ships by defining your coordinates in each of the ship objects (however a better implementation would be to query the user when Driver.java is initially run).

This project was made as part of the interview process as a Software Engineer Intern at T. Rowe Price. Unfortunately, I did not get the position however I enjoyed making this game and practicing my Java & OOP skills.
